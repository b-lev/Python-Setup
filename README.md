# Python-Setup
This page provides some general advice on how to set up your local environment to code with Python.

In the examples below, we are going to focus on Python 3.9, and we'll give version numbers for all other tools so that
you can avoid unexpected errors. 

# Editor

There are many ways to interact with python. We are going to focus on using an editor to save files to your local disk and then running the files from a command line terminal. Some people swear by emacs and vi/vim. Another option is to use ipython. Here we are going to focus on Visual Studio Code (vs code, for short).

You can [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) vs code for linux, mac, and windows. It's generally the same for all platform. (The main difference is the shortcut keys used to quickly do things like save or open.)
